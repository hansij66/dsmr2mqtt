# DSMR MQTT
MQTT client for Belgian and Dutch Smart Meter (DSMR) - "Slimme Meter". Written in Python 3.x

Connect Smart Meter via a P1 USB cable to e.g. Raspberry Pi.

Application will continuously read DSMR meter and parse telegrams.
Parsed telegrams are send to MQTT broker.

Includes Home Assistant MQTT Auto Discovery.

In `dsmr50.py`, specify:
* Which messages to be parsed
* MQTT topics and tags
* Auto discovery for Home Assistant

A typical MQTT message broadcast looks like:
```json
{
"V1":226.0,
"V2":232.0,
"V3":229.0,
"database":"dsmr",
"el_consumed":24488767.0,
"el_returned":21190375.0,
"p_consumed":1130.0,
"p_generated":0.0,
"serial":"33363137",
"timestamp":1642275125
}
```

A virtual DSMR parameter is implemented (el_consumed and el_returned, which is sum of tarif1 and tarif2 (night/low en day/normal tariff)) - as some have a dual tarif meter, while energy company administratively considers this as a mono tarif meter.

## Requirements
Install following python3 libraries
* paho-mqtt
* pyserial
* persist-queue

## Test the P1 adapter & USB connection:
Test if P1 adapter is functional and is providing dsmr data by running in a bash shell:
* `tail -f /dev/ttyUSB0`
* optionally first execute `sudo chmod o+rw /dev/ttyUSB0`
* Results should be similar to:
   ```
  tail -f /dev/ttyUSB0
  
  /Ene5\T210-D ESMR5.0

  ```

## Installation & Configuration
* Install Python3 packages per recommendation for your distro
* Install from github and configure:
  * mkdir & cd to your install location 
  * git clone https://github.com/hansij66/dsmr2mqtt.git
  * cd dsmr2mqtt/ 
* In `systemd/dsmr-mqtt.service`:
  * Adapt ExecStart under [Service] to ExecStart=/<your location>/dsmr-mqtt.py (default: `/opt/iot/dsmr`)
* sudo cp -p systemd/dsmr-mqtt.service /etc/systemd/system
* Copy `config.rename.py` to `config.py` and adapt for your configuration (minimal: mqtt ip, username, password)
  * Edit the MQTT configuration and know that the MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX = "dsmr" will show these messages as topic dsmr/. Configuration will be shown as homeassistant/sensor/dsmr/

* `sudo systemctl enable dsmr-mqtt`
* `sudo systemctl start dsmr-mqtt`
* And check if it is running properly
  * sudo systemctl status dsmr-mqtt
    ```python
    user@server:/opt/dsmr2mqtt $ sudo systemctl status dsmr-mqtt
    dsmr-mqtt.service - P1 dsmr smartmeter

Use
* http://mqtt-explorer.com/
to test &  inspect MQTT messages

A `test/dsmr.raw` simulation file is provided.
Set `PRODUCTION = False` in `config.py` to use the simulation file. No P1/serial connection is required.

Tested under Debian/Raspbian.
Tested with DSMR v5.0 meter in Netherlands and Belgium. For other DSMR versions, `dsmr50.py` needs to be adapted.
For all SMR specs, see [netbeheer](https://www.netbeheernederland.nl/dossiers/slimme-meter-15/documenten)
For Belgium/Fluvius, open your P1 port through [Fluvius portal](https://mijn.fluvius.be/): 

For encrypted P1/dsmr, there is a [fork](https://github.com/wehrmannit/dsmr2mqtt) available.
